# selection-sort


### Objective

In this project, we will cover the fundamentals of a `Selection Sort Algorithm`, and its operations.


### Problem

 Returns a sorted array for `[90,70,10,1,0,30]` using the selection sort Algorithm.

### Implementation

Build a method `selectionSort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array then prints it in the main method.

```java
public class Main {

 static void main(String[] args){

          /* your code here */
  }
}
```
